# üöÄ Dynamic Portfolio Builder

This project is a web application built with **Java Servlets, JSP, and Tailwind CSS** that empowers users to create stunning, interactive, and fully responsive personal portfolios in just a few minutes. It's designed for developers, designers, and creatives who need a quick and professional way to showcase their skills and projects to potential clients or employers.

The core of this application leverages the power of the Java Servlet API to handle all backend logic, demonstrating a robust server-side architecture.

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture & Core Concepts

This project was built with a strong emphasis on server-side rendering and business logic handled by **Java Servlets**, following the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** design pattern.

### The Role of Java Servlets (The "Controller")

Servlets form the backbone of this application. They are responsible for:

1.  **Handling All Incoming Requests:** Every user action, from logging in to submitting portfolio data, is mapped to a specific servlet. For example, a `ProfileServlet` handles requests to `/profile`, and a `ProjectServlet` manages requests related to adding or updating projects.
2.  **Processing Business Logic:** Servlets contain the core logic. They validate user input, interact with the database (e.g., saving user details, fetching projects), and manage the user's session state.
3.  **Data Management:** After processing a request, the servlet prepares the necessary data (e.g., a list of projects, user information) and attaches it to the request object.
4.  **Request Dispatching:** Finally, the servlet forwards the request (along with the prepared data) to the appropriate JSP file for rendering the view. It never generates HTML directly.

### The Role of JSP (The "View")

JavaServer Pages (JSP) are used purely for the presentation layer. Their job is to dynamically generate the HTML that is sent back to the client's browser.

1.  **Rendering Dynamic Content:** JSPs receive data from the servlets. They use Expression Language (`${...}`) and the JSTL (JSP Standard Tag Library) to access this data and embed it into the HTML structure.
2.  **Templating:** We use JSP to create reusable UI components like headers, footers, and portfolio sections, making the frontend code clean and maintainable.
3.  **Client-Facing Output:** The final output of a JSP is a pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript page, styled beautifully with Tailwind CSS. The client's browser never sees any Java code.

This clear separation of concerns makes the application scalable, secure, and easier to debug.

Request Flow:
Client Browser -> Web Server (Tomcat) -> Servlet (Controller) -> Database/Logic -> Servlet -> JSP (View) -> HTML to Client
```
